        Purpose
        -------
        This application is a simple middleware and associated decorator that
        will add a ".mobile" attribute to your request objects, which, if
        True, means the requester is coming to you from a mobile phone
        (cellphone), PDA, or other device that should be considered small
        screened, or have an underpowered browser, such as games consoles.
        
        
        History
        -------
        This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/minidetector/
        
        The original project hasn't had an update since 2008, and is poorly
        packaged.
        
        This fork packaged the module and uploaded it to pypi.
