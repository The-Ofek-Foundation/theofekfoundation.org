<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>A graphical representation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The width of each connection means how often it is used.</p>

<p>Dijkstra's algorithm is used to connect the blue node to all other nodes.</p>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<p>Just hit 'n' to generate a new set of nodes. Not much to it.</p>

<h3>Technical Stuff</h3>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, just shoot me an email.</p>
