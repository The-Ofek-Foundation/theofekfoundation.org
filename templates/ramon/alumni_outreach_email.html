Hey {{ alumnus.first_name }}, <br />
Seuss/Ramon AZA's Annual Turkey Bowl Reunion is next week, Thursday November 23rd at 9AM. Come destroy MoAd at football and shmooze with other alumni and active Alephs! As always, we'll be at Joaquin Miller Middle School, 6151 Rainbow Dr, San Jose, California 95129.
<br /><br />
We're also updating the <a href="{{ google_sheet_database_url}}" target="_blank">Seuss/Ramon Alumni Directory</a>. It's very thorough until class of 2003, help us make it even better! Also make sure you're in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/628172203966431/">Alumni Facebook group</a> and the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4533758">Alumni Linkedin group</a>.
<br /> <br />
The chapter is 59 Alephs strong in its 26th year and the current Grand Aleph Godol is Ron Hasson, a Ramonian class of 2017. Come to Turkey Bowl to hear and share more stories!
<br /><br />
Thank you and FratSub, <br />
Idan Hovav
