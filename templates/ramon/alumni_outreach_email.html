Hey {{ alumnus.full_name }}, this is Ofek Gila, a recent Alumnus of Ramon AZA #195

<br /><br />

First of all, I want to invite you to this year's Turkey Bowl, hosted next week on Thursday (November 23rd), at Joaquin Miller Middle school. Hope to see you there!

<br /><br />

On another note, a couple of Seuss and Ramon Alumni have been working on making a database of our Alumni, and we'd love it if you could take a few minutes and update your information, or maybe even add missing people, contact info for people you know, etc.â€”anything would be much appreciated. This would make it easier for Ramon to contact us for future events/reunions.

<br /><br />

You can find the database here: <a href="{{ google_sheet_database_url}}" target="_blank">{{ google_sheet_database_url }}</a>

<br /><br />

Also, in order to verify that your email address is still active, please go to the following url: <a href="{{ img_url }}" target="_blank">{{ img_url }}</a>
